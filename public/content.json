I’ve put a link to the wholeplaylisthere&gt;) Pre-ReadingSo there are a few things I’d like to discuss before we actually delve into whyI chose this one marvelous scene and why I feel this scene is so important tokicking off the more than 30 film MCU franchise. Archetypes of Superheroes Tony Stark’s 5 Dramatic Situations How a Scene fits into Storytelling/Film Archetypes of SuperheroesThe file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of thenavigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the New file button inthe file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the New folderbutton. Tony Stark’s 5 Dramatic SituationsIn36 Dramatic Situations&gt;)Mike Figgis explores the base 36 dramatic situations that make up the majorityof all scenes in storytelling. Most stories are made up of only a handful ofthese situations that recur throughout the characters’ lives. In analyzing the appearances of Tony Stark in the MCU we can find that hisstories are governed by 5 core Dramatic Situations. The Enigma Daring Enterprise Disaster Remorse Necessity of Sacrifice (This is more rare than the others as it is the most dramatic and apex ofTony’s Dramatic situations) How a Scene fits into Storytelling/FilmInJohn Truby’s Anatomy of Story&gt;)he outlines that scenes are where the writer translates the elements ofstorytelling and character and presents them to the audience. A scene is defined as ONE action in ONE time and ONE place. But the bestscenes are mini-stories which hold all the elements of storytelling. So attheir core, scenes and stories are the same. If you visualize a scene as atriangle, the beginning frames what the scene is about then funnels andculminates to a single point. A story is just a scene at a larger scale. You construct the scene as a mini-story by Determining how it fits in the overall development of the character(s) Hitting the same beats as your story Ending on the climactic, single point of your story Delete a fileYou can delete the current file by clicking the Remove button in the fileexplorer. The file will be moved into the Trash folder and automaticallydeleted after 7 days of inactivity. Export a fileYou can export the current file by clicking Export to disk in the menu.

This allows you to keepwriting on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with,integrate easily into your workflow… The synchronization mechanism takes placeevery minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading filemodifications. There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other: The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settingsautomatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any otherdevice. &gt; To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in themenu. The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with oneor multiple files in Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub. &gt; Beforestarting to sync files, you must link an account in the Synchronizesub-menu.

Once opened in theworkspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.

A merge will beperformed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved. If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click theSynchronize now button in the navigation bar. Note: The Synchronize now button is disabled if you have no file tosynchronize. Manage file synchronizationSince one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and managesynchronized locations by clicking File synchronization in theSynchronize sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronizedlocations that are linked to your file.

ProTip: You can disable any Markdown extension in the Fileproperties dialog. Archetypes of Tony StarkOne of the main criticisms of superhero sequels is that they tend to rehash thesame themes and stories as their first installment. As far as character andstory go, the main reason for The Dark Knight having a such a positive criticalreception is that the archetype of Batman that is explored evolved from film tofilm. As shown below, Batman begins principally follows Bruce Wayne’s journey as thewarrior. He is on a journey of master as a student of Ra’s al Ghul. What madeThe Dark Knight so interesting is that it did not reset the archetype of Batman,but instead allowed his character to naturally evolve into the Master role ofthe Hero. The Ruler. The Dark Knight then explored the story of Batman as theRuler of Gotham and explores those theme’s by contrasting him against Rulers ofdifferent aspects of Gotham. Batman (Chris Nolan, David S Goyer, Bob Kane) WARRIOR/HERO RULER Aspect Ego Self Method Mastery Control Drive Leave a Mark Leave a Mark Role Student Master Shadow The Ends Justify the Means Tyranny I believe that the biggest reason that Iron Man has remained so popularthroughout the life of the MCU, deliberately or through accident, is because hischaracter has evolved so much through the archetypical structure thoughout hisscreentime.
