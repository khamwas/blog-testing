I've put a link to the whole\nplaylist\n[here](<[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VQinJxH6A&list=PLd7v7nQLQGwKQxfPtUPz6i1h3-JVxBx0D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2VQinJxH6A&list=PLd7v7nQLQGwKQxfPtUPz6i1h3-JVxBx0D)>)\n\n## Pre-Reading\n\nSo there are a few things I'd like to discuss before we actually delve into why\nI chose this one marvelous scene and why I feel this scene is so important to\nkicking off the more than 30 film MCU franchise.\n\n- [Archetypes of Superheroes](#archetypes-of-superheroes)\n- [Tony Stark's 5 Dramatic Situations](#tony-starks-5-dramatic-situations)\n- [How a Scene fits into Storytelling/Film](#how-a-scene-fits-into-storytellingfilm)\n\n### Archetypes of Superheroes\n\nThe file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the\nnavigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in\nthe file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder**\nbutton.\n\n### Tony Stark's 5 Dramatic Situations\n\nIn\n[36 Dramatic Situations](<[https://www.talkhouse.com/mike-figgis-procrastination-screenwriting-epiphany-new-book/](https://www.talkhouse.com/mike-figgis-procrastination-screenwriting-epiphany-new-book/)>)\nMike Figgis explores the base 36 dramatic situations that make up the majority\nof all scenes in storytelling. Most stories are made up of only a handful of\nthese situations that recur throughout the characters' lives.\n\nIn analyzing the appearances of Tony Stark in the MCU we can find that his\nstories are governed by 5 core Dramatic Situations.\n\n- The Enigma\n- Daring Enterprise\n- Disaster\n- Remorse\n- Necessity of Sacrifice\n  > (This is more rare than the others as it is the most dramatic and apex of\n  > Tony's Dramatic situations)\n\n### How a Scene fits into Storytelling/Film\n\nIn\n[John Truby's Anatomy of Story](<[http://wegrowmedia.com/bittersweet/part-15-of-how-i-use-john-truby-to-outline-fiction-who-is-this-guy/](http://wegrowmedia.com/bittersweet/part-15-of-how-i-use-john-truby-to-outline-fiction-who-is-this-guy/)>)\nhe outlines that scenes are where the writer translates the elements of\nstorytelling and character and presents them to the audience.\n\n> A scene is defined as ONE action in ONE time and ONE place. But the **best**\n> scenes are mini-stories which hold all the elements of storytelling. So at\n> their core, scenes and stories are the same. If you visualize a scene as a\n> triangle, the beginning frames what the scene is about then funnels and\n> culminates to a single point. A story is just a scene at a larger scale.\n\nYou construct the scene as a mini-story by\n\n- Determining how it fits in the overall development of the character(s)\n- Hitting the same beats as your story\n- Ending on the climactic, single point of your story\n\n## Delete a file\n\nYou can delete the current file by clicking the **Remove** button in the file\nexplorer. The file will be moved into the **Trash** folder and automatically\ndeleted after 7 days of inactivity.\n\n## Export a file\n\nYou can export the current file by clicking **Export to disk** in the menu. You\ncan choose to export the file as plain Markdown, as HTML using a Handlebars\ntemplate or as a PDF.\n\n# Synchronization\n\nSynchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to\nsynchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google\nDrive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep\nwriting on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with,\nintegrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place\nevery minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file\nmodifications.\n\nThere are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:\n\n- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings\n  automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other\n  device. > To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the\n  menu.\n\n- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one\n  or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**. > Before\n  starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize**\n  sub-menu.\n\n## Open a file\n\nYou can open a file from **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub** by opening\nthe **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Open from**. Once opened in the\nworkspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.\n\n## Save a file\n\nYou can save any file of the workspace to **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or\n**GitHub** by opening the **Synchronize** sub-menu and clicking **Save on**.\nEven if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another\nlocation. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.\n\n## Synchronize a file\n\nOnce your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically\nsynchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be\nperformed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.\n\nIf you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the\n**Synchronize now** button in the navigation bar.\n\n> **Note:** The **Synchronize now** button is disabled if you have no file to\n> synchronize.\n\n## Manage file synchronization\n\nSince one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage\nsynchronized locations by clicking **File synchronization** in the\n**Synchronize** sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized\nlocations that are linked to your file.\n\n# Publication\n\nPublishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files.\nOnce you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms\nlike **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**,\n**WordPress** and **Zendesk**. With\n[Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over\nwhat you export.\n\n> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish**\n> sub-menu.\n\n## Publish a File\n\nYou can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking\n**Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following\nformats:\n\n- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it\n  (**GitHub** for instance),\n- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog\n  for example).\n\n## Update a publication\n\nAfter publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which\nmakes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you\nwant to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the\nnavigation bar.\n\n> **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been\n> published yet.\n\n## Manage file publication\n\nSince one file can be published to multiple locations, you can list and manage\npublish locations by clicking **File publication** in the **Publish** sub-menu.\nThis allows you to list and remove publication locations that are linked to your\nfile.\n\n# Markdown extensions\n\nStackEdit extends the standard Markdown syntax by adding extra **Markdown\nextensions**, providing you with some nice features.\n\n> **ProTip:** You can disable any **Markdown extension** in the **File\n> properties** dialog.\n\n## Archetypes of Tony Stark\n\nOne of the main criticisms of superhero sequels is that they tend to rehash the\nsame themes and stories as their first installment. As far as character and\nstory go, the main reason for The Dark Knight having a such a positive critical\nreception is that the archetype of Batman that is explored evolved from film to\nfilm.\n\nAs shown below, Batman begins principally follows Bruce Wayne's journey as the\nwarrior. He is on a journey of master as a student of Ra's al Ghul. What made\nThe Dark Knight so interesting is that it did not reset the archetype of Batman,\nbut instead allowed his character to naturally evolve into the Master role of\nthe Hero. The Ruler. The Dark Knight then explored the story of Batman as the\nRuler of Gotham and explores those theme's by contrasting him against Rulers of\ndifferent aspects of Gotham.\n\n### Batman (Chris Nolan, David S Goyer, Bob Kane)\n\n|        | WARRIOR/HERO               | RULER        |\n| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------ |\n| Aspect | Ego                        | Self         |\n| Method | Mastery                    | Control      |\n| Drive  | Leave a Mark               | Leave a Mark |\n| Role   | Student                    | Master       |\n| Shadow | The Ends Justify the Means | Tyranny      |\n\nI believe that the biggest reason that Iron Man has remained so popular\nthroughout the life of the MCU, deliberately or through accident, is because his\ncharacter has evolved so much through the archetypical structure thoughout his\nscreentime.\n\n### Iron Man (Jon Favreau, Josh Whedon, Shane Black, Stephen McFeely, Christopher Markus)\n\n|        | MAGICIAN       | WARRIOR/HERO                 | RULER          | MENTOR            |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| Aspect | `Self`         | `Ego`                        | `Self`         | `Self`            |\n| Method | `Power`        | `Mastery`                    | `Control`      | `Knowledge`       |\n| Drive  | Order          | `Leave a Mark`               | `Leave a Mark` | Spiritual Journey |\n| Role   | `Master`       | Student                      | `Master`       | `Master`          |\n| Shadow | Abuse of Power | `The Ends Justify the Means` | Tyranny        | `Arrogance`       |\n\n## KaTeX\n\nYou can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using\n[KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):\n\nThe _Gamma function_ satisfying $\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\\quad\\forall n\\in\\mathbb N$\nis via the Euler integral\n\n$$\n\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\\,.\n$$\n\n> You can find more information about **LaTeX** mathematical expressions\n> [here](http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).\n\n## UML diagrams\n\nYou can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For\nexample, this will produce a sequence diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?\nBob-->>John: How about you John?\nBob--x Alice: I am good thanks!\nBob-x John: I am good thanks!\nNote right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.\n\nBob-->Alice: Checking with John...\nAlice->John: Yes... John, how are you?\n```\n\nAnd this will produce a flow chart:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))\nA --> C(Round Rect)\nB --> D{Rhombus}\nC --> D\n```\n","tags":["Marvel","MCU","Iron Man","One Marvelous Scene","Nando v Movies"],"categories":["Blogs"]},{"title":"Hello World","url":"/Reviews/hello-world/","content":"\nWelcome to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)!
